# Introduction #

In this essay, I show the very basics of transpiling a diagram to code.

I call this DaS - Diagrams as Syntax.

If you want to follow along, see Appendix - Getting Started.

There's nothing new here - just a combination of already-existing technologies.

This should look ridiculously simple.  

You should find yourself yawning through most of this.  

If it doesn't seem simple enough, I haven't done my job well.  

I am happy to answer questions.
